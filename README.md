# ChickenPower
A 2 relay Arduino project for a Chicken Coop.  1 Light, 1 water heater

The RealTime Clock DS3231 keeps time so we can turn the light on and off for daylight hours.  The DS3231 also has a temperature module, so I'll keep that under the water bowl to keep it from freezing (and will turn the heater relay on and off based on temperature).
